This is my flask/hardware/python/web project. 

TODO:
1. fix confusion in app.py, such as forward function links to backward function because of hardware fault
2. draw up schematics
3. add some pretty pictures to the github
4. maybe remove two second movement and add a stop button(or implement both versions with seperate GUI)
